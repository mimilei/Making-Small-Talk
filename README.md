# Making Small Talk!


This is the directory that holds the lecture materials for the Making Small Talk Session held at ITP Camp 2020.

### Running the examples

Open a terminal and enter

`python3 -m http.server 8000 --bind 127.0.0.1`


Then head over to

`localhost:8000`

in your browser and you will see a directory with all of the examples.  If you want to code along you can use the `start.html` boilerplate.
